                        <h2>About</h2>
                        The College Dropout is the debut studio album by American rapper and producer Kanye West.
                         It was released on February 10, 2004, by Def Jam Recordings and Jay-Z's Roc-A-Fella Records.
                          In the years leading up to release, West had received praise for his production work for rappers
                           such as Jay-Z and Talib Kweli, but faced difficulty being accepted as an artist in his own right
                            by figures in the music industry. Diverging from the then-dominant gangster persona in hip hop,
                             West's lyrics concern themes of family, self-consciousness, materialism, religion, racism, and
                              higher education.

                              Late Registration is the second studio album by American rapper and producer Kanye West. It was released on August 30, 2005, through Def Jam Recordings and Roc-A-Fella Records. West's production for Late Registration departed from the sped-up soul samples of his debut studio album, moving towards a more elaborate and orchestral style with a 20-piece ensemble. West experimented with musical shifts, string arrangements, and a variety of instruments not usually associated with hip hop, including a celesta, harpsichord, and Chinese bells.

Inspired by stadium tours, house-music and indie rock, Graduation marked a departure as West incorporated layered synthesizers and dabbled with electronics while sampling from various music genres and altering his approach to rapping. He conveys an ambivalent outlook on his newfound fame and media scrutiny alongside providing inspirational messages of triumph directed at listeners.

                              808s & Heartbreak is the fourth studio album by American rapper Kanye West. It was released by Def Jam Recordings and Roc-A-Fella Records on November 24, 2008. 808s & Heartbreak marked a major musical departure from West's previous rap records, instead featuring a sparse, electronic sound and vocals sung through an Auto-Tune processor. West's lyrics on the album explore themes of loss, alienated fame, and heartache, inspired by the breakup with his fiancée, his struggles with pop stardom, and the death of his mother.
                                <br><br>
                              Although West conceived 808s & Heartbreak as a melancholic pop album, it proved to have a significant effect on hip hop music. While his decision to sing about love, loneliness, and heartache for the entirety of the album was at first heavily criticized by music audiences and the album predicted to be a flop, its subsequent critical acclaim and commercial success encouraged other mainstream rappers to take greater creative risks with their music.

                              My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is the fifth studio album by American rapper and producer Kanye West. It was released by Def Jam Recordings and Roc-A-Fella Records on November 22, 2010, following a period of public controversy for West. The music has a notable maximalist aesthetic and opulent production style that utilizes various elements from West's previous work, including soul, pop, baroque, electro, and symphonic sounds, as well as progressive rock influences. The album's lyrics explore themes such as West's celebrity status, consumer culture, self-aggrandizement, and the idealism of the American Dream.

                              Watch the Throne is a collaborative studio album by American rappers Jay-Z and Kanye West, collectively known as The Throne.It was released on August 8, 2011, through Roc-A-Fella Records, Roc Nation, and Def Jam Recordings. Prior to the release, Jay-Z and West had collaborated on various singles, and with the latter as a producer on the former's work. They originally sought to record a five-song EP together, but the project eventually evolved into a full-length album. The braggadocious lyrics exhibit themes of excellence, opulence, decadence, fame, materialism, power, and the burdens of success, as well as political and socioeconomic critique. The album also expresses other topics, such as Jay-Z's thoughts on fatherhood, West's reflection on being deemed a social villain, and their success as performers.

                        <h2>About</h2>
                              Donda is the tenth studio album by American rapper Kanye West, released through GOOD Music on August 29, 2021. The album's style has been described variously as hip hop, gospel, progressive rap, and pop, and incorporates elements of trap and drill. It is both minimalist and maximalist, with darker lyrical content and the reduced use of drums in comparison to West's prior efforts. Themes explored include religion, Kanye's divorce from Kim Kardashian, and his mother Donda West, the album's namesake whom the release is dedicated to.
